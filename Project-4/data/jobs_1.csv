The Challenge Ahead:
As we look to the next 50 years, we have to be prepared for challenges that might pull at the social fabric we have worked so hard to build. Our citizens’ needs are getting more complex, and people want to be consulted in decision-making. We are also seeing a greater diversity of orientations towards key policy areas, with a more active and vocal civil society.
Young people are the leaders of tomorrow. How we nurture them and stir their imaginations today will impact the kind of future Singapore we create. The youth demographic (perhaps more than any other citizen sector) is ever evolving and youth communities are increasingly heterogeneous, especially with globalisation and digitalisation. Our policies would need to be responsive to these shifts in the landscape, to ensure youth needs are well-supported through transitions and to develop future-ready youth who are committed to Singapore.
 
Responsibilities
You will be part of a team that develops policies on youth engagement and development, constantly seeing opportunities for (re-)invention.
We are looking for people who can keep the big picture in focus, while being very grounded in real citizens’ sentiments/ issues. Apart from being able to make sense of data and statistics, we want people who are passionate about uncovering the human stories behind every policy gap. You will synthesise these needs and desires, and use them to generate new insights to guide policy. You will need to understand quickly the landscape you are operating in, and the policy trade-offs involved. You will draw on diverse approaches such as systems thinking, behavioural economics, and user-centric design etc. You will work in teams to co-create solutions. You will prototype your ideas, to fail early in order to learn fast. You will tell stories to inspire decision-makers, communicating key messages clearly and with an understanding of the context/ audience.
 
Requirements

Previous related experience
Professional training or equivalent working experience in the fields of public policy, political science, philosophy, economics, education, social work, sociology, psychology.
Demonstrated capacity for understanding and developing strategy
Able to manage multiple competing priorities

 
Ideal Characteristics / Traits

You need to have a keen grasp of national objectives in the context of people’s needs and their environment, make connections between insights and public policy and/or service, and think about connected systems rather than problems in isolation. Broad thinking, with awareness of trends across different fields, would be beneficial.
You are most likely someone who is curious, analytical, and imaginative, constantly questioning the status quo and dreaming up ideas to make the world better.
You should be comfortable engaging with stakeholders across public, people, and private sectors, and be able to anticipate and solve problems. Collaboration is key here.
You should have excellent communication and inter-personal skills, with proven ability to take initiative and build strong, productive relationships.
