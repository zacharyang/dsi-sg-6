"Suntec Tower Two, 9 Temasek Boulevard 038989",Six Financial Information Singapore Pte. Ltd.,17 Feb 2019,18 Jan 2019,Full Time,"Roles & ResponsibilitiesThe SSO group provides business support services to the front line sales channels within the financial information business of SIX. The Head of SSO in APAC is the functional line leader for all staff who fall into the remit of the unit, working in close co-operation with the sales channel leaders and the local management structures. The Head of SSO APAC is the leader for this regional group, providing vision and direction for their reporting staff members. They are also expected to perform all senior management functions for the group including staff selection, motivation and management, performance and delivery management and financial reporting and control. Finance and HR support is provided by the functional teams of those groups. In this particular case (APAC) the location of the teams are Singapore and Tokyo but in aggregate is not a large team and hence it is expected that the incumbent will also play a part directly with customers and potential customers. To this end, experience in regulatory and compliance requirements in the middle and back office, and the underlying data requirements that these create would be a distinct advantage. The role reports into Head Business Development, MPP.","RequirementsMain Duties 1. A key positive aspect of the SIX engagement model with clients is the quality and expertise of the staff and resources we deploy is support of the sales force during the sales process. The Regional Manager Role in SSO role is primarily responsible for the delivery and management of product, service and sales support in the defined region. Some regions will operate on a ‘hub and spoke’ basis where a number of countries are supported as ‘spokes’ from the central location. The rational for this is to allow the development of resources in strength and depth and to allow the limited support staff in smaller countries to access the resources and expertise of an entire department easily and quickly. 2. The Regional Manager will organize and manage resources on a regional basis to provide effective sales support to the three sales channels. It is envisaged that these services will include data consulting, integration services, API and interfacing training and consulting and client facing project management, i.e. to facilitate the sales of our complete offering of products and services both technically and administratively. 3. Functionally, this will cover pre-sales support, quote/proposal production, support for entitlements set up, delivery and installation etc. In most of these elements, there is the need to liaise effectively with the global group who have ultimate responsibility for the function e.g. Finance, Legal, Technology etc. 4. Resources (both in terms of quantity and skill set) should be planned so that support can be economically and efficiently provided where it is required, with some skills provided locally, and others provided regionally (or in a few cases globally) to achieve the economies of scale and scope. Where possible and sensible, these should map onto the organization of the sales channels to foster a close and supportive working relationship. 5. Certain team members will also take on responsibility for ‘Expert Support’ working closely with GDO, MPP and the Partner business . This will mainly be for problems or service/content deficiencies that need to be pro-actively managed to a successful conclusion on a client-by-client basis over a period of time. We expect that the majority of the ‘Expert Support’ is actually provided by the Project Managers – they manage the long term problems to resolution and are well placed to manage the expectations of the client – something that a helpdesk by its very nature cannot do easily. It addition, SSO will have the domain experts that may well be required for analysis of detailed or ongoing problems. The Regional Manager may well get involved in particularly difficult or high visibility problems, including leading to a resolution. 6. Many projects will involve working alongside business partners by offering integration support for SIX data into a partner’s solution, or integrating an element from the partner into a solution provided by SIX. The SSO group will work closely with the Partners team to deliver such integration and project support. Of particular importance here is the recognition, protection and growth of the value that SIX adds into the overall solution such that we do not get marginalized by an aggressive partner. It is also important that such solutions lead to repeatable, high value sales opportunities for SIX, rather than remaining as ‘once-off’ deals. Your Profile We are looking for a self-starter who can work independently yet be equally comfortable working within a team within a matrix organisation.  A solid understanding of Market Regulation and its impact on Financial institutions and regulatory topics is necessary, as is a general knowledge of a variety of asset classes (Equity, Fixed Income, Commodity, Funds and FX markets).  An appreciation of the compliance and regulatory framework within financial institutions.  Good presentation, documentation and communication (oral and written) skills. Ability to build strong relationships with prospects, clients and internal stakeholders and document detailed requirements.  A solid understanding of Sales and Project Management lifecycles.  Demonstrate enthusiasm to learn about, and maintain, their knowledge of the details of the market, including regulation, competitive positioning, technical issues around data delivery and current ‘hot topics’ in the industry.",Head Of Sso (Apac),5.0,144000.0,Monthly,216000.0,Middle Management
